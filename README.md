# Side by side browsing - chrome extension
Synchronised browsing between 2 windows.
Made to visually compare 2 browser windows.

Scrolls and clicks are synchronised between the 2 windows.

Access to the site has to be enabled within the extension.

This is a work in progress.

Todo:
Hovers are not working, so when you click on a element that is visible after hover, the second window will not go to the next page.
